## DeepMind - the *Alpha* projects.

I first heard about <a href="https://deepmind.com/">Google's DeepMind</a> with their amazing Alpha- gaming projects. They began building self-learning neural networks to master one of the oldest and *the* most complex board game - Go. This project (aptly named *AlphaGo Zero*) was the first of several game-conquering quests which were, among other things, meant to challenge our human preconceptions on these very deep subjects.

*AlphaGo Zero* was the first artificial player to defeat a top human player; similar to IBM's *Deep Blue* famously defeating world champion Gary Kasparov in 1997. This shook the gaming world as well as the world of AI, but it was only the beginning. 

AlphaZero was trained in Shogi and Chess, leading to similar mind-blowing victories against the best computer engines in the world. Arguably the three most complex board games, which in some way represented the pinnacle of human intellectual capabilities, had been toppled by the *Alpha* project.

*AlphaZero* was also recently trained in a real-time-strategy game - StarCraft II, named *AlphaStar* - which is vastly more complex in its decision-making requirements. Challenges include variable play environments, dozens of units / upgrades, not to mention the raw massive scale of the play area - some maps having dimensions of 200 x 200 “map tiles”. *AlphaStar* defeated a top professional 5-0 and, after some controversy retrained with more “fair” playing constraints, was relaunched into the player pool. The AI again climbed the ladder to an elite league - “Grandmaster” - which consists of the top 200 players on the server.

Being a huge gaming fan and a competitive chess player myself, these feats were amazing and inspiring to me personally. However, DeepMind’s goal was not to become the ultimate “gamer bot”, but solve the world’s problems. 

The headline at DeepMind’s webpage says, “What if solving one problem could unlock solutions to thousands more?”

## Enter *AlphaFold*

While I don’t have a background in biology, this is one of the exciting promises of the DeepMind project. After using games as a “playground” for the AI architectures, these neural networks went to the task of predicting the 3d structure of a protein. 

*AlphaFold* accepted the challenge, and after it’s first breakthrough in 2018 has absolutely shattered the ceiling on accuracy in these predictions.

It has occurred decades before many people in the field would have predicted. It will be exciting to see the many ways in which it will fundamentally change biological research."

It’s this kind of advancement in the scientific field where neural networks really flex their strengths.

Neural Networks’ decision-making and predictions is the way of the future. It excites me that the pattern recognition required to win a game of chess or go is quite similar to the pattern recognition required to solve the most cutting-edge problems we have in our society.
