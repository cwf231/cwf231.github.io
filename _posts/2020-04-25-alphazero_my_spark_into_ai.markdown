Like every other kid, I was taught how to play chess and played for fun for most of my young life. I always felt that there was something very honest about the game - unlike most card games where there's a lot of deception and missing information. It wasn't until later in my life that I wanted to get serious about the game and compete in tournaments. 
My uncle was my mentor - an expert player who started competing after the American chess boom of the 70's inspired by the great Bobby Fischer. Back then, chess was simpler. The methods of learning were 1. Watching the highest-level games and, 2. Reading textbooks written by teams of grandmasters.

In 1997 however, the chess world was shaken up. IBM developed a chess engine, *Deep Blue* which, for the first time, was able to defeat a grandmaster (the world champion and arguably the greatest of all time no less). It became apparent that computers' tactical ability and computing power was too much for even the strongest human to handle...and that was in the late 90's...

As processing power increased, so did the strength of these engines. They quickly became unstoppable competitors and invaluable analysis-partners. My uncle would often refer to '*The Beast*' - the world's strongest engine, *Stockfish.* Stockfish analysis was considered gospel in the chess world. World Champions rely on its help in understanding complicated positions because of its unrelenting tactical strength. Its prowess is based on raw computing power - 70 million moves per second.
In recent years, computers have been relegated to competing in the *Top Computer Engine Championship* (TCEC). This competition, since 2013, has been largely dominated by the Stockfish engine.

Fast forward to 2017 when a headline stopped me in my tracks:

 ***Google's AlphaZero Destroys Stockfish In 100-Game Match***
 
*Wait, what?*

I had been privy to the mind-blowing documentary *AlphaGo* which follows the creation of the first machine which would challenge a world champion Go player. The game of Go is about 4000 years old and it has a entire culture devoted to its mastery, similar to chess. (I won't spoil it for you, as you are probably racing to your streaming services.) Apparently, there was another neural network in the works?

**AlphaZero:** After 4 hours of 'practice', the neural network *obliterated* the best engine in the world in a 100-game match - 28 wins without losing a game. The most startling point is that AlphaZero analyzed a mere 80,000 moves per second (0.1% compared to its competitor). It clearly 'understands' the game much, much differently. It looks to me like I'm watching an alien play the game. It took centuries of long-standing theory and blew it away completely. Moves which used to be understood as 'normal' and strategically sound were uprooted without a second thought.
So many moves were novel and unrecognizable and deep and genius that it really calls into question our understanding of the game at its core.

I could go on and on about how impressive it is from a chess standpoint, but from that moment on I became fascinated in the world of neural networks and its impact on the world. If a game could be torn down and build back up in a matter of hours, how else could our lives be improved?

My fascination with the strength of computers led me to writing my first lines of code; creating my first terminal-based games (which then evolved into more complicated games); to attempting to create a new baseball stat...

It became obvious this is where my passion and future lies.
